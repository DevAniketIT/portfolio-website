## 📋 Actions Completed

### ✅ 1. Project Organization
- **Created main portfolio directory**: `aniket-portfolio/`
- **Organized projects into clean directories**: Each project now has its own dedicated folder
- **Moved all project files**: Properly organized without data loss
- **Maintained project integrity**: All functionality preserved during move

### ✅ 2. File Cleanup
- **Removed generated files**: Cleaned up `__pycache__`, `*.pyc`, and log files
- **Preserved essential data**: Kept `demo_prices.db` for demonstration purposes
- **Maintained working files**: All source code and documentation preserved
- **Created comprehensive .gitignore**: Prevents future generated files from being tracked

### ✅ 3. Documentation Creation
- **Main Portfolio README**: Professional overview linking all 5 projects
- **Project READMEs**: Each project has detailed documentation
  - **job-application-tracker**: Already had comprehensive README (preserved)
  - **job-tracker-api**: Already had detailed README (preserved)
  - **price-monitor**: Created new detailed README with usage examples
  - **python-fundamentals**: Created comprehensive learning journey README
  - **ai-automation**: Already had business-focused README (preserved)

### ✅ 4. Professional Setup
- **MIT License**: Open source license for professional presentation
- **Git-ready structure**: Proper .gitignore for Python development
- **Clean organization**: No loose files, everything properly categorized
- **Portfolio presentation**: README showcases technical skills and project value
